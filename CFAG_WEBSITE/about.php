            <p>
                CFAG Church exists to glorify God by making disciples of Jesus Christ in every generation.
                We seek to be a Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered, and mission-focused community.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision a church where people from every background encounter Jesus, grow in spiritual
                maturity, and are equipped to serve their families, neighborhood, and the nations.

                <li>The Bible is God’s inspired Word and our final authority.</li>
                <li>There is one God eternally existent in three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
                <li>Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone.</li>
                <li>The Church is the body of Christ, called to make disciples of all nations.</li>
                <li>We eagerly await the return of Jesus Christ and the restoration of all things.</li>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            CFAG Church began with a small group of believers gathering in a living room to pray
            for their city. Over the years, God has grown our community into a multi-generational
            family following Jesus together.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the beginning, we have been committed to God’s presence, biblical teaching,
            and sending people into their neighborhoods, workplaces, and the nations with the
            good news of Jesus.
